# Guitar Jammer

Connect to the Spotify API and control the playback of music with your feet so you can jam

## How this works

I have a midi controller, that I've mapped to the Spotify API. I can control playback while practicing guitar with my midi controller instead of the Spotify user interface.

## Why not just use your phone?

The phone locks, the phone falls asleep, you get notifications, etc. This should be the beginning of a better system for focused practice of the guitar with one of the largest(?) catalogs of music available.

The end goal here is to have a better interface to practice playing guitar.
